        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around *objects*, which are instances of *classes*. In OOP, the focus is on creating and interacting with objects rather than functions or logic alone. Each object is a self-contained unit that includes both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key concepts of OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Classes and Objects**\n",
        "   - **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "   - **Object**: An instance of a class. Each object can have different values for its attributes, but they share the same methods as defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Car:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
        "           self.make = make\n",
        "           self.model = model\n",
        "       \n",
        "       def start_engine(self):\n",
        "           print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is running.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Creating objects\n",
        "   car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
        "   car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "   - Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit (class).\n",
        "   - It also involves controlling access to the object's internal state, typically using *public*, *private*, or *protected* access modifiers.\n",
        "   - This ensures that the data is only modified in controlled ways through methods, protecting the object's integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class BankAccount:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "           self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "       def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "           if amount > 0:\n",
        "               self.__balance += amount\n",
        "\n",
        "       def get_balance(self):\n",
        "           return self.__balance\n",
        "\n",
        "   account = BankAccount(1000)\n",
        "   account.deposit(500)\n",
        "   print(account.get_balance())  # Outputs: 1500\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Inheritance**\n",
        "   - Inheritance allows a new class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent class), enabling code reuse and extension.\n",
        "   - The child class can also override or extend the behavior of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Animal:\n",
        "       def speak(self):\n",
        "           print(\"Animal sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   class Dog(Animal):  # Inherits from Animal class\n",
        "       def speak(self):\n",
        "           print(\"Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   dog = Dog()\n",
        "   dog.speak()  # Outputs: Woof!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "   - Polymorphism means that different classes can be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance. It allows methods to behave differently depending on the object type that calls them.\n",
        "   - The most common form is *method overriding*, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "       def speak(self):\n",
        "           print(\"Meow!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Polymorphism\n",
        "   def make_animal_speak(animal):\n",
        "       animal.speak()\n",
        "\n",
        "   make_animal_speak(dog)  # Outputs: Woof!\n",
        "   make_animal_speak(Cat())  # Outputs: Meow!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Abstraction**\n",
        "   - Abstraction hides the complex implementation details and exposes only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "   - In OOP, this is typically achieved using abstract classes or interfaces, which define methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example (using Python's `abc` module):\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "   class Shape(ABC):\n",
        "       @abstractmethod\n",
        "       def area(self):\n",
        "           pass\n",
        "\n",
        "   class Circle(Shape):\n",
        "       def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "           self.radius = radius\n",
        "\n",
        "       def area(self):\n",
        "           return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
        "\n",
        "   circle = Circle(5)\n",
        "   print(circle.area())  # Outputs: 78.5\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of OOP:\n",
        "1. **Modularity**: Code is organized into separate classes and objects, making it easier to maintain.\n",
        "2. **Reusability**: Inheritance allows you to reuse code across different classes.\n",
        "3. **Scalability**: OOP makes it easier to scale the application by creating new objects or extending existing classes.\n",
        "4. **Maintainability**: Since data and behavior are encapsulated, changes to an object’s behavior can be made without affecting the rest of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP is widely used in modern software development, and many programming languages (like Python, Java, C++, and C#) are designed to support OOP principles.                                                                                                                                   "

        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (often called **properties** or **fields**) and **methods** (also known as functions or behaviors) that describe the characteristics and actions of objects created from the class. A class essentially serves as a mold from which individual instances (or objects) of that class can be instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key components of a class:\n",
        "1. **Attributes/Properties**: These are variables that store the state or data of an object. For example, a `Car` class might have attributes like `color`, `make`, and `model`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Methods**: These are functions that define the behavior or actions that an object can perform. For example, a `Car` class might have methods like `start_engine()`, `stop()`, or `accelerate()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Constructor**: A special method (usually named `__init__` in languages like Python) used to initialize an object when it is created, often setting initial values for its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Inheritance**: A class can inherit properties and methods from another class, allowing for code reuse and hierarchy. For example, a `SportsCar` class can inherit from the `Car` class and add more specific features.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Encapsulation**: A class can restrict direct access to its internal attributes and provide controlled access through methods (often called getter and setter methods). This helps in managing the complexity of the system.\n",

        "**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features or functionalities. It helps to reduce complexity by providing a simple interface and hides the internal workings that the user does not need to know about.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Points:\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Simplifies interaction with complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and focusing on what the object does rather than how it does it.\n",

        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- **Inheritance** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (the **child class** or **subclass**) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (the **parent class** or **superclass**). Inheritance promotes code reuse, enables the creation of hierarchical relationships, and allows for easier maintenance and scalability of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Parent Class (Superclass)**:\n",
        "   - The class that provides common attributes and methods to be inherited by subclasses.\n",
        "   - It defines the general properties and behaviors that can be shared across multiple subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Child Class (Subclass)**:\n",
        "   - The class that inherits the attributes and methods from the parent class.\n",
        "   - It can **extend** the parent class by adding additional attributes and methods or **override** parent class methods to provide specific implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Method Overriding**:\n",
        "   - A child class can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class. This is known as **method overriding**.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Code Reusability**:\n",
        "   - The child class automatically inherits the behavior of the parent class, allowing developers to avoid redundant code and enhance reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Extensibility**:\n",
        "   - Subclasses can be added to extend the functionality of the parent class without modifying the parent class itself, which helps in maintaining existing code and adding new features.\n",

        "### Key Points in the Example:\n",
        "1. **Inheritance**: The `Car` and `Bike` classes inherit from the `Vehicle` class. This means they automatically have the `start_engine()` and `stop_engine()` methods, which are defined in the `Vehicle` class.\n",
        "2. **`super()`**: The `super()` function is used to call the parent class’s constructor and methods. In this case, it's used to initialize the `brand` and `model` attributes in the child classes.\n",
        "3. **Method Extension**: The child classes (`Car` and `Bike`) extend the parent class by adding their own specific methods (`open_doors()` and `ring_bell()`).\n",
        "4. **Code Reuse**: Both `Car` and `Bike` use the `start_engine()` and `stop_engine()` methods from the `Vehicle` class, which avoids code duplication.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Multiple Inheritance**:\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - A class inherits from a child class, forming a multi-level chain of inheritance.\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - Multiple subclasses inherit from the same parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Truck(Vehicle):\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Hybrid Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - A combination of multiple types of inheritance. This can involve multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance together.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from a parent class, reducing redundancy and making the codebase easier to maintain.\n",
        "2. **Extensibility**: You can extend and modify the functionality of the parent class without changing its code.\n",
        "3. **Hierarchy**: Inheritance allows for a natural hierarchy of classes, making the design of your system more intuitive.\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Inheritance enables **polymorphism**, where a subclass can override methods from the parent class and provide its own implementation, giving flexibility to the behavior of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "Inheritance in OOP allows for the creation of new classes based on existing ones, which leads to more efficient, organized, and reusable code. It helps you structure your software in a way that models real-world relationships and hierarchies."

        "- **Polymorphism** is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single function or method to operate on different types of objects, making code more flexible, reusable, and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **\"Many Forms\"**:\n",
        "   - The word \"polymorphism\" comes from Greek, meaning \"many forms.\" In OOP, polymorphism means that a single method or function can operate on objects of different classes in different ways, depending on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Method Overriding**:\n",
        "   - In polymorphism, a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This is known as **method overriding**.\n",
        "   - The method in the parent class has the same signature (name and parameters) as the one in the child class but can have a different implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Method Overloading** (less common in Python, more common in languages like Java):\n",
        "   - In some OOP languages, polymorphism can also refer to **method overloading**, where multiple methods with the same name exist, but with different parameter types or numbers of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dynamic Method Dispatch**:\n",
        "   - In languages like Python, polymorphism is typically achieved via **dynamic method dispatch** (also called **late binding**), where the method that is called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism** (Static Polymorphism):\n",

        "- ### Encapsulation in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation** is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit or class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's internal data. This helps protect the object's integrity by preventing outside interference and misuse of its internal state. In Python, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers, primarily by convention and some built-in mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Encapsulation is Achieved in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Public Attributes and Methods**:\n",
        "   - By default, all attributes and methods in Python are **public**, meaning they can be accessed directly from outside the class. Public attributes and methods are part of the external interface of the class, and there are no restrictions on access.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Person:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "           self.name = name  # Public attribute\n",
        "           self.age = age    # Public attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "       def greet(self):\n",
        "           print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",

        "   person.greet()      # Calling public method\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Private Attributes and Methods**:\n",
        "   - To achieve encapsulation, you can make attributes and methods **private** by prefixing them with two underscores (`__`). This prevents direct access to those attributes or methods from outside the class. However, Python does not strictly enforce this encapsulation, but uses **name mangling** to make it harder to access private variables directly.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Person:\n",

        "   - `__greet` is a **private method**.\n",
        "   - The `set_name` and `get_name` methods are **public methods** that provide controlled access to the private `__name` attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Name Mangling**:\n",
        "   - Python uses **name mangling** to make private variables harder to access directly. When you prefix an attribute or method with double underscores (`__`), Python internally renames the attribute by adding `_ClassName` before the attribute name. For instance, `__name` becomes `_Person__name`. While this does not make the variable truly private, it prevents accidental access.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Person:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name):\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Note**: Name mangling is more of a convention that signals that an attribute or method is private and should not be accessed directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Protected Attributes and Methods**:\n",
        "   - Python does not have a strict concept of \"protected\" members like languages such as Java or C++. However, by convention, attributes or methods that are meant to be \"protected\" (accessible only within the class and its subclasses) are prefixed with a single underscore (`_`). This serves as a warning that these members are intended for internal use and should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",

        "           self._age = age    # Protected attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "       def _greet(self):  # Protected method\n",

        "\n",
        "   class Student(Person):\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name, age, grade):\n",
        "           super().__init__(name, age)\n",
        "           self._grade = grade  # Accessing protected attribute from parent class\n",

        "   - `_name` and `_age` are **protected attributes** (meant for internal use or inheritance).\n",
        "   - `_greet` is a **protected method**.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Getter and Setter Methods**:\n",
        "   - A common practice to encapsulate private attributes is to use **getter** and **setter** methods. These methods allow controlled access to private attributes, ensuring that any updates or retrievals of those attributes are done according to specific rules or constraints.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "               self.__name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "       def get_age(self):  # Getter method for age\n",
        "           return self.__age\n",
        "\n",
        "       def set_age(self, age):  # Setter method for age\n",
        "           if age > 0:  # Add validation to ensure positive age\n",
        "               self.__age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "   person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "   print(person.get_name())  # Access private attribute via getter\n",
        "   person.set_name(\"Bob\")  # Modify private attribute via setter\n",
        "   print(person.get_name())\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this example:\n",
        "   - `get_name()` and `set_name()` provide controlled access to the private `__name` attribute.\n",
        "   - Similarly, `get_age()` and `set_age()` provide controlled access to the private `__age` attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Using `@property` for Getter/Setter (Pythonic Approach)**:\n",
        "   - Python provides a built-in decorator `@property` to define **getter** methods that look like attributes. The `@property` decorator can also be used to define setter methods using `@<property_name>.setter`.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Person:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "           self.__name = name\n",
        "           self.__age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "       @property\n",
        "       def name(self):  # Getter for name\n",
        "           return self.__name\n",
        "\n",
        "       @name.setter\n",
        "       def name(self, value):  # Setter for name\n",
        "           if value:  # Add validation here\n",
        "               self.__name = value\n",
        "\n",
        "       @property\n",
        "       def age(self):  # Getter for age\n",
        "           return self.__age\n",
        "\n",
        "       @age.setter\n",
        "       def age(self, value):  # Setter for age\n",
        "           if value > 0:\n",
        "               self.__age = value\n",
        "\n",
        "   person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "   print(person.name)  # Access via property (getter)\n",
        "   person.name = \"Bob\"  # Modify via setter\n",
        "   print(person.name)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   With this approach, the `name` and `age` attributes are accessed as though they are public, but under the hood, they are private and their values can only be changed or accessed through the setter and getter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Encapsulation:\n",
        "1. **Data Hiding**: Internal object data is hidden from outside manipulation, protecting the integrity of the object.\n",
        "2. **Controlled Access**: You can control how attributes are accessed or modified, enforcing rules and validation.\n",
        "3. **Code Maintainability**: By controlling how attributes are accessed, you can change the internal implementation without affecting the external interface.\n",
        "4. **Security**: Sensitive data can be encapsulated, and only authorized access is permitted, ensuring better security.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "In Python, **encapsulation** is achieved by using public, protected, and private attributes and methods. While Python does not enforce strict access control like some other languages, it relies on conventions like name mangling and the use of getter and setter methods to achieve encapsulation. By using these features, you can protect the internal state of objects, control how data is accessed, and provide a clean and maintainable interface for users of the class."

        "- ### Constructor in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "A **constructor** in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is instantiated (created). Its primary role is to initialize the newly created object by setting up initial values for its attributes. In Python, the constructor method is defined using the `__init__` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "1. **Special Method**: The constructor is a special method, denoted by `__init__`. This method is automatically invoked when a new object of the class is created.\n",
        "2. **Initialization**: It is used to initialize the object’s state (i.e., assign values to the object’s attributes) when the object is created.\n",
        "3. **Self Parameter**: The first parameter of the constructor is always `self`, which refers to the instance of the class being created. It allows the constructor to access the instance’s attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax:\n",

        "        # More initialization code can go here\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Constructor in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name  # Initialize the name attribute\n",
        "        self.age = age    # Initialize the age attribute\n",
        "\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation of the Example:\n",
        "1. **`__init__(self, name, age)`**:\n",
        "   - The constructor takes two parameters, `name` and `age`, which are used to initialize the instance attributes `self.name` and `self.age`.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Object Creation**:\n",
        "   - `person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)` creates an instance of the `Person` class.\n",
        "   - The constructor `__init__` is called automatically when the object is created, initializing the `name` and `age` attributes with the provided values `\"Alice\"` and `30`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Accessing Attributes**:\n",
        "   - You can access the object's attributes (`name`, `age`) and methods (`greet()`) once the object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points About the Constructor (`__init__`):\n",
        "1. **Automatic Invocation**: The constructor is automatically called when an object is instantiated. You do not need to call it explicitly.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **No Return Value**: The constructor does not return any value, not even `None` (although it implicitly returns `None` when no return is specified).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Multiple Parameters**: You can define multiple parameters in the constructor to allow initialization with different values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Default Arguments**: The constructor can also have default argument values, so you can create objects even if not all parameters are passed during instantiation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example with Default Arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name=\"Unknown\", age=0):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object without passing arguments\n",
        "person1 = Person()  # Default values are used: name=\"Unknown\", age=0\n",
        "person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Unknown and I am 0 years old.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object with passed arguments\n",
        "person2 = Person(\"Bob\", 25)\n",
        "person2.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Constructor and Inheritance:\n",
        "When a class inherits from another, the child class can call the constructor of the parent class using the `super()` function to initialize attributes inherited from the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example with Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "        super().__init__(name)  # Call the parent class constructor\n",
        "        self.breed = breed\n",
        "\n",

        "**Method Overloading** is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but with different arguments (number of arguments or types of arguments). However, unlike languages like Java or C++, Python does not support traditional method overloading directly. This means that you cannot define multiple methods with the same name and different signatures (number of arguments or types) in the same class.\n",

        "- ### Method Overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method overriding** is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The new method in the subclass has the same name, same parameters (signature), and the same return type as the one in the superclass. When an object of the subclass calls the method, the subclass's version of the method is executed, not the superclass's version.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "- **Inheritance**: Method overriding occurs in the context of inheritance, where a subclass inherits methods from its parent (superclass).\n",
        "- **Same Method Signature**: The method in the subclass must have the same name, parameters, and return type as the one in the superclass.\n",
        "- **Dynamic Dispatch**: Python uses **dynamic method dispatch**, meaning that the method that is called is determined at runtime based on the object’s type (i.e., whether it is an instance of the parent class or the subclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use Method Overriding?\n",
        "- **Customization**: Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its specific behavior for a method defined in the superclass, thereby customizing or extending functionality.\n",
        "- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding is a key feature that enables polymorphism, where different subclasses can have their own versions of a method while maintaining a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Method Overriding:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "cat.speak()  # Output: Cat meows\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- **`Animal` class**: This class has a method `speak()` which prints a generic message `\"Animal makes a sound\"`.\n",
        "- **`Dog` class**: The `Dog` class inherits from `Animal` but overrides the `speak()` method to print `\"Dog barks\"`.\n",
        "- **`Cat` class**: Similarly, the `Cat` class also inherits from `Animal` and overrides the `speak()` method to print `\"Cat meows\"`.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we create objects of `Dog` and `Cat`, and call the `speak()` method:\n",
        "- The version of `speak()` that gets called is the one defined in the subclass, not in the `Animal` class.\n",
        "- This demonstrates **method overriding**, where the behavior of the method is changed in the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Method Overriding Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Subclass method**: The subclass provides its own version of the method, with the same signature as the method in the superclass.\n",
        "2. **Runtime resolution**: When the method is called on an object, Python determines the actual method to invoke based on the object's class, not the reference type.\n",

        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- ### Why is Polymorphism Important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism** is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **abstraction**. It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass, typically through a common interface. The term \"polymorphism\" comes from Greek, meaning \"many forms,\" and it refers to the ability of a single function, method, or operator to work with different types of data or objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "In OOP, polymorphism provides the ability for objects to take many forms, meaning that different classes can define methods with the same name but with different behaviors, depending on the class they belong to.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Benefits of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Polymorphism allows you to write more flexible and reusable code. It allows different classes to be used interchangeably as long as they follow the same interface or method signature. This makes it easier to extend your codebase with new classes that implement the same methods but with their own specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Code Simplification**: By using polymorphism, you can call the same method or function on different objects without needing to know the exact type of the object. This reduces the complexity in the code, as you don’t need to write specific conditions for each type.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Ease of Maintenance**: Polymorphism enables developers to modify or add functionality in one place without affecting the entire codebase. If a new class is added, as long as it adheres to the expected interface or base class, it can seamlessly integrate with the existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Increased Code Reusability**: Polymorphism enhances reusability by allowing the same function or method to be applied to objects of different types. You can create general algorithms or functions that work with various objects, which reduces the need to rewrite code for different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Achieving Runtime Flexibility (Dynamic Polymorphism)**: Through dynamic polymorphism (using method overriding), objects of different subclasses can be treated uniformly at runtime, allowing for dynamic behavior based on the object’s actual type.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main types of polymorphism in OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**:\n",
        "   - This type of polymorphism is resolved at **compile-time**. It typically involves **method overloading** or **operator overloading**, where multiple methods or operators with the same name exist but with different parameters or types.\n",
        "   - Example: In languages like Java or C++, you can have multiple methods with the same name but different argument types or counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "   *Note*: Python does not support **method overloading** directly, but you can achieve similar behavior using **default arguments** or **variable-length arguments**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**:\n",
        "   - This type of polymorphism is resolved at **runtime** and involves **method overriding**.\n",
        "   - In method overriding, a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "   - It allows the method call to resolve to different methods based on the object's actual type at runtime, even if the reference type is the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, polymorphism is most commonly achieved through **inheritance** and **method overriding**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example: Polymorphism with Method Overriding\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",

        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):  # Method Overriding\n",

        "make_animal_speak(cat)  # Output: Cat meows\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- **Superclass (`Animal`)** has a method `speak()`, which is overridden in the subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`.\n",
        "- The function `make_animal_speak()` accepts an `Animal` object but can work with any object that is a subclass of `Animal`. This is polymorphism in action: the same function is called for both `dog` and `cat`, but it invokes different methods based on the actual object type.\n",
        "- **Runtime Resolution**: When `make_animal_speak(dog)` is called, Python uses the `speak()` method from the `Dog` class, and when `make_animal_speak(cat)` is called, Python uses the `speak()` method from the `Cat` class, even though both are referenced as `Animal`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits in Real-World Scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Simplifies Code**: Polymorphism simplifies code maintenance and readability. You can write a general method (like `make_animal_speak`) that operates on objects of various classes, but each subclass can implement its specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reusability**: Polymorphism allows you to reuse the same function or method across different types of objects, making your code more modular and easier to extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Decoupling**: It decouples the code that uses objects from the actual implementation details of the objects. This promotes **loose coupling**—a desirable feature in software engineering, where you can modify or extend the behavior of classes without affecting the code that uses them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: Polymorphism with Different Interfaces\n",
        "\n",
        "Another common example of polymorphism occurs when multiple classes share the same interface (method signature), but each class implements its version of the method.\n",

        "draw_shape(triangle)  # Output: Drawing a triangle\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- All classes (`Square`, `Circle`, `Triangle`) implement the same method `draw()`.\n",
        "- The function `draw_shape()` works with any object that has a `draw()` method, regardless of the specific class type.\n",
        "- This allows you to extend the program by adding new shapes without modifying the `draw_shape()` function, demonstrating both **polymorphism** and **open/closed principle**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism is important in OOP because it:\n",
        "1. **Increases flexibility** by allowing objects of different types to be treated through a common interface.\n",
        "2. **Encourages code reuse** by enabling you to write functions or methods that can handle a variety of types and behaviors.\n",
        "3. **Supports dynamic behavior** via method overriding, enabling runtime decisions based on object types.\n",
        "4. **Simplifies maintenance** by allowing you to add new classes and behaviors without altering existing code.\n",

        "Ultimately, polymorphism contributes to building cleaner, more modular, and maintainable code, which is critical for large-scale software development.

        "\n",
        "An **abstract class** in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed by other classes. It can contain abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but have no implementation in the abstract class itself. Subclasses of the abstract class are required to provide their own implementation of these abstract methods.\n",

        "### Why Use Abstract Classes?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Enforce a Common Interface**: An abstract class can define common methods that all subclasses must implement. This ensures that every subclass follows the same interface.\n",
        "2. **Code Reusability**: Abstract classes allow you to write common functionality in the parent class, which can then be reused by subclasses.\n",

        "In addition to abstract methods, abstract classes can also have **concrete methods**—methods that have a full implementation. These concrete methods can be used as is by subclasses or can be overridden if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "class Shape(ABC):\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def area(self):\n",
        "        pass  # Abstract method\n",
        "\n",
        "    def description(self):\n",
        "        return \"This is a geometric shape\"  # Concrete method\n",

        "\n",
        "circle = Circle(5)\n",
        "print(circle.area())         # Output: 78.5\n",
        "print(circle.description())  # Output: This is a geometric shape\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- The `Shape` class is abstract, with an abstract method `area` and a concrete method `description`.\n",
        "- The `Circle` class implements the `area` method, but it can use the `description` method from `Shape` without needing to override it.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "1. **Abstract Methods**: Methods marked with `@abstractmethod` must be implemented by any subclass. If they are not implemented, an error will be raised.\n",
        "2. **Concrete Methods**: An abstract class can have methods with full implementations (concrete methods), which can be used directly by subclasses or overridden.\n",
        "3. **Abstract Base Class (ABC)**: To make a class abstract, it must inherit from `ABC` (from the `abc` module). The `@abstractmethod` decorator marks the methods as abstract.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Abstract Classes?\n",
        "- **Common Interface**: Use abstract classes when you want to define a common interface for a group of related classes, but the implementation details differ. Subclasses must provide their specific behavior while adhering to the common structure.\n",
        "- **Avoid Instantiating Base Class**: When you don't want to allow the instantiation of a base class, but you want to enforce that subclasses provide specific implementations.\n",
        "- **Framework Design**: Abstract classes are often used in the design of frameworks or libraries where you want users to define their own subclasses and implementations of abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "- An **abstract class** in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
        "- It can contain **abstract methods**, which must be implemented by any subclass.\n",

        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- ### Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP offers numerous advantages that help improve the design, maintainability, scalability, and reusability of code. Here's a breakdown of the key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Modularity (Encapsulation)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Modular Code**: In OOP, code is organized into classes and objects, which are self-contained. Each class represents a specific concept or functionality, making the code easier to understand, manage, and maintain.\n",
        "- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a class. This helps in hiding the internal details of the class and exposing only what is necessary through interfaces (getter and setter methods). This leads to better protection of data and avoids unintended interference.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Easier maintenance, modification, and protection of internal states.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Reusability (Inheritance)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Code Reusability**: One of the greatest strengths of OOP is the ability to reuse code through **inheritance**. A class can inherit properties and methods from another class. The child class can reuse, extend, or modify the behavior of the parent class.\n",
        "- **Extending Functionality**: Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class, adding new methods or properties without altering the original class.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Reduces redundancy, speeds up development, and promotes code reuse across different parts of an application.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Flexibility (Polymorphism)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Method Overloading and Overriding**: Polymorphism allows methods to have different meanings or implementations based on the object that calls them. This enables the use of a single interface to represent different underlying forms (e.g., same method name in different classes but with different implementations).\n",
        "- **Dynamic Behavior**: With polymorphism, you can have different objects respond to the same method in different ways, providing flexibility in how the system behaves at runtime.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Increases flexibility and scalability by allowing new functionality to be added without changing the interface or code that depends on the polymorphic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Maintainability and Scalability**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Easier Maintenance**: OOP principles encourage writing small, self-contained classes that perform specific tasks. This organization makes it easier to locate, fix, or update parts of the system without affecting other parts.\n",
        "- **Modular Updates**: When changes are needed (for example, a new feature or modification), OOP allows you to modify or extend one part of the system without affecting other parts. This leads to better manageability as the project grows.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Helps developers to build and maintain large systems, and makes it easier to update and scale the application over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Data Security (Encapsulation)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Controlled Access**: Through encapsulation, internal states and data of an object can be hidden from the outside world. Access to these private members can be controlled via public methods (getters and setters), ensuring that data is protected from unintended manipulation.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Helps prevent data corruption or unintended side effects by controlling how data is accessed and modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Inheritance and Code Reduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Avoid Duplication**: Inheritance allows you to write code that can be reused across multiple classes, reducing the need to duplicate the same code across different parts of the application.\n",
        "- **Hierarchical Structure**: The class hierarchy can be extended to introduce more functionality at higher levels, while the core behavior is maintained at lower levels.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Reduces code duplication, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Easier Debugging and Testing**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Isolated Bugs**: Since objects are self-contained, bugs are usually confined to a specific class or module, making them easier to identify and fix. This is particularly useful in large systems where debugging can otherwise become overwhelming.\n",
        "- **Unit Testing**: OOP facilitates unit testing by making objects and classes independently testable. Each class can be tested in isolation to ensure it behaves as expected.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Makes the debugging and testing process simpler, improving the reliability and stability of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Real-World Modeling (Abstraction)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Modeling Real-World Entities**: OOP makes it easier to model real-world entities as objects in the software system. For example, a class might represent a car, and attributes like `color`, `make`, and `model` would describe the car, while methods like `start()` or `stop()` would define its behavior.\n",
        "- **Abstraction**: Abstraction allows you to focus on the relevant aspects of the system while hiding the unnecessary details. You define an object by its behavior and attributes, and the complex implementation details are hidden inside the class.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Makes it easier to represent complex systems and real-world entities in a simplified way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **Improved Collaboration (Team Development)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Clear Structure**: OOP encourages clear modular structure where different team members can work on different classes or modules simultaneously. Since classes are self-contained and focused on specific tasks, they can be developed and tested independently.\n",
        "- **Separation of Concerns**: OOP promotes the separation of concerns, where each class focuses on a specific responsibility or functionality. This leads to better division of labor in a team setting.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Enhances team collaboration and reduces the risk of merge conflicts and redundant work.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. **Improved Software Design (SOLID Principles)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **SOLID Principles**: OOP encourages good software design practices, such as the SOLID principles, which help in writing maintainable, flexible, and scalable code. These principles include:\n",
        "  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class should have only one responsibility.\n",
        "  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
        "  - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.\n",
        "  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.\n",
        "  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Helps in creating more robust, extensible, and maintainable software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. **Code Readability and Organization**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Structured Code**: OOP promotes writing organized code in the form of objects and classes. This organization often makes code easier to read, understand, and navigate.\n",
        "- **Naming Conventions**: Classes, methods, and attributes are typically named to reflect real-world concepts, which helps new developers quickly understand the system’s design.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Benefit**: Easier to understand, read, and work with code, especially for new team members.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. **Increased Productivity and Time-Saving**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Faster Development**: OOP allows you to design and develop software quickly by using inheritance and polymorphism, reusing pre-existing code, and reducing redundancy. Once the classes are defined, new functionality can often be added with minimal effort.\n",
        "- **Standardized Libraries**: Many OOP libraries and frameworks are available, reducing the need for developers to build common functionality from scratch.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Benefit**: Reduces the time and effort required for development, helping you deliver software more quickly.\n",

        "bat.sleep()  # Defined in Bat\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- **`Animal` class** has a `speak()` method.\n",
        "- **`Bird` class** has a `fly()` method.\n",
        "- **`Bat` class** inherits from both `Animal` and `Bird`, and it also defines its own `sleep()` method.\n",
        "- When we create an instance of `Bat`, we can call methods from both parent classes (`speak` from `Animal` and `fly` from `Bird`) in addition to the methods defined in `Bat`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
        "\n",
        "When a method is called on an instance of a class, Python uses the MRO to determine which class's method to invoke. The MRO is determined by the **C3 Linearization algorithm** in Python, which ensures a consistent method resolution order.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can view the MRO of a class using the `mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "print(Bat.mro())  # Prints the MRO of the Bat class\n",
        "```\n",

        "[<class '__main__.Bat'>, <class '__main__.Animal'>, <class '__main__.Bird'>, <class 'object'>]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The MRO tells us that Python will search for methods in the following order:\n",
        "1. `Bat` (the current class)\n",
        "2. `Animal` (the first parent class)\n",
        "3. `Bird` (the second parent class)\n",
        "4. `object` (the base class for all classes in Python)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Code Reusability**: Multiple inheritance allows you to reuse code from multiple parent classes without duplicating it in the subclass.\n",
        "2. **Combining Behaviors**: You can combine the functionalities of multiple parent classes to create a more complex and versatile subclass.\n",
        "3. **Flexible Design**: It provides flexibility in designing classes, as subclasses can inherit from several sources of behavior and attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Pitfalls of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "While multiple inheritance is a powerful feature, it can introduce complexity and potential issues, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Method Resolution Order (MRO) Conflicts**: If two parent classes define the same method, Python uses the MRO to decide which method to call. However, this can lead to confusion and unintended behavior if not properly managed.\n",
        "2. **Diamond Problem**: This occurs when two parent classes of a subclass have a common ancestor, leading to ambiguity in method resolution. For example:\n",
        "   - Class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, and both `B` and `C` inherit from `A`. If `B` and `C` both override a method from `A`, Python could face ambiguity in determining which version of the method to call.\n",
        "   - Python handles this with the C3 Linearization algorithm, but it's important to be aware of these complexities.\n",
        "\n",

        "d = D()\n",
        "d.method()  # Which method will be called?\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, Python follows the MRO to decide which `method()` to call. The MRO will be:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "D -> B -> C -> A\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the output will be:\n",

        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `__del__` method in Python is a special method used to define an object's **destructor**. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed, i.e., when its reference count drops to zero, and the memory occupied by the object is going to be reclaimed. The method is part of Python's garbage collection mechanism, which automatically handles memory management and object cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points about `__del__`:\n",
        "1. **Object Destruction**: The `__del__` method is invoked when an object is being destroyed, typically when the reference count drops to zero. This can happen explicitly (e.g., using `del`) or implicitly when the object goes out of scope or the program ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Purpose**: It is mainly used to clean up resources that are not automatically handled by Python's garbage collection, such as closing files, network connections, or releasing other system resources like database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Usage**:\n",
        "   - The method is written in the form:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class MyClass:\n",
        "         def __del__(self):\n",
        "             print(\"Object is being destroyed\")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - When the object is deleted or goes out of scope, Python calls the `__del__` method automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Limitations**:\n",
        "   - **Unpredictability**: Python’s garbage collection is non-deterministic, meaning that you cannot reliably predict the exact time when `__del__` will be called. This is because garbage collection may occur at a time that is not directly under your control.\n",
        "   - **Cyclic References**: If there are cyclic references (objects referring to each other in a cycle), Python's garbage collector may not immediately collect the objects, and `__del__` might not be called as expected. This is especially relevant when using reference-counting garbage collection in CPython, where cyclic references are handled by the garbage collector in a separate process.\n",
        "   - **Resource Cleanup**: The `__del__` method should not rely on external resources being available, as the object’s environment may have already been partially cleaned up by the time `__del__` is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Exceptions in `__del__`**: If an exception occurs inside `__del__`, it is ignored, and Python does not propagate it, meaning that any errors that occur in `__del__` won’t disrupt the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Resource:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        print(f\"{self.name} resource created\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"{self.name} resource is being destroyed\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create an instance of Resource\n",
        "r = Resource(\"File\")\n",
        "# Output: File resource created\n",
        "\n",
        "# Delete the instance\n",
        "del r\n",
        "# Output: File resource is being destroyed\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Avoid `__del__`:\n",
        "- **Avoid excessive reliance on `__del__`** for critical resource management. It's better to use context managers (`with` statement) for managing resources like files and database connections, which ensure that resources are properly cleaned up even in the case of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use `__del__` only for cleanup that can't be handled by other means** (like `with` blocks or using the `atexit` module).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Alternatives to `__del__`:\n",
        "- **Context Managers** (`__enter__` and `__exit__` methods): These are more predictable and reliable for resource management. With a context manager, you can ensure that resources are cleaned up as soon as the block of code finishes executing.\n",
        "- **`atexit` module**: Used for handling cleanup actions when the program terminates, regardless of object-specific destruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "The `__del__` method serves as a destructor for cleanup in Python, but due to the unpredictability of garbage collection, it is often better to use other mechanisms (like context managers) to manage resources explicitly."

        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python, especially in the context of inheritance, refers to the ability of different classes to provide a common interface for the same method or behavior, but with each class implementing it differently. This concept allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, but each class can define its own specific behavior for the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of Polymorphism in Python with Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Method Overriding**: In a subclass, you can define a method that has the same name as a method in the superclass. This is called **method overriding**. When you call this method on an instance of the subclass, the subclass's version of the method will be executed instead of the superclass’s method. This is a core feature of polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Duck Typing**: Python uses a feature called \"duck typing,\" where an object's suitability for use in a context is determined by its behavior (methods or attributes) rather than its actual type. In other words, if an object behaves like an instance of a particular class (i.e., has the required methods), it can be treated as such, even if it is not formally derived from that class.\n",

        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "-  **Method chaining** in Python is a programming technique where multiple method calls are made in a single statement, with each method returning the object itself (or a reference to the object). This allows you to call multiple methods on the same object consecutively without needing to break them into separate lines or expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concept of Method Chaining:\n",
        "- **Return the object (`self`)**: For method chaining to work, each method in the chain must return the object itself (`self`). This ensures that after each method call, the object remains available for the next method call in the chain.\n",
        "- **Fluent Interface**: Method chaining often results in a \"fluent interface,\" where you can write code in a more readable and concise manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Method Chaining in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say we have a class `Person` that allows setting various attributes of a person, and we want to chain the method calls to set these attributes.\n",

        "print(person)  # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30, City: New York\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation of the Example:\n",
        "- In the `Person` class, we have methods like `set_name()`, `set_age()`, and `set_city()`.\n",
        "- Each of these methods modifies the object’s attributes and **returns the object itself (`self`)**.\n",
        "- By returning `self`, we allow calls to these methods to be chained together in a single statement.\n",
        "- The final output prints the person's details, showing how the attributes were set using method chaining.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Method Chaining:\n",
        "1. **Concise Code**: Method chaining makes the code more compact by avoiding the need for multiple separate method calls.\n",
        "2. **Readable**: When used properly, method chaining can make the code more fluent and readable, as it clearly expresses a sequence of actions on the same object.\n",
        "3. **Improved Maintainability**: Chaining can make it easier to modify or extend functionality by adding more methods to the chain without changing how the object is manipulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Use Cases:\n",
        "- **Fluent Interfaces**: Method chaining is often used in libraries or APIs to provide a fluent interface, such as in configuration settings or builder patterns.\n",
        "- **Data Modelling**: In object-oriented data manipulation, such as setting multiple attributes of an object or structuring queries.\n",
        "- **UI/Graphics Libraries**: Many graphical libraries use method chaining to modify attributes of UI elements (like buttons, panels, or shapes).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example with a Builder Pattern:\n",
        "\n",
        "A typical scenario where method chaining is used is in the **Builder Pattern**. Here's an example of building a complex object with chained methods:\n",

        "- We chain the method calls together to build a customized pizza in a single statement, improving readability and organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Things to Keep in Mind:\n",
        "1. **Returning `self`**: For method chaining to work, each method must return `self` so that the next method can be called on the same object.\n",
